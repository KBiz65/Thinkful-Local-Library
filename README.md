## Vanilla JavaScript App

_A program to search through data and render it on the screen_

## Summary

This is the first project in the Thinkful Bootcamp. The purpose of this project is to get comfortable writing JavaScript functions and using popular methods. Some methods used are filter, find, map, reduce, sort, and more.

The back end of this project was already completed as well as the HTML/CSS. I was only responsible for writing the JavaScript functions.
